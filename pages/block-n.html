      <h2>Favorite class</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="begin">At St. Albans</span>, especially in our later years, we are given the freedom to choose from a vast array of classes.
        Using this freedom, I have selected classes which have personal significance to me, regardless of difficulty or
        appearance on my transcript. However, from these classes, one holds an extraordinary amount of value to me.
        This course is A.P. Omnibus History, a combination of American and European history. There are several reasons
        for my great interest in this class. First, I am fascinated by the cyclical nature of the past. I see these
        recurring political, economic, and social trends as a means of looking forward into the future, while allowing
        us to avoid the mistakes of the past. Second, history teaches many lessons about the nature of human behavior,
        both past and present, providing insight into the actions, desires, and aspirations of those around me. Finally,
        it lays a solid foundation for several disciplines, including political science, economics, and international
        relations, three fields of great interest to me.

      <p>
        <span class="begin">In the past</span> four years of my life, no activity has affected me more than wrestling. Four years of varsity
        wrestling and the honor of being a team captain has instilled many qualities in me. First, through years of
        hard work and continuous dieting, wrestling has given me discipline. This discipline has spread to other parts
        of my personality, including my moral character, work ethic, and perserverence. Another quality wrestling has
        given me is leadership. As a team captain, I have learned to lead by example, both on and off the mat. Above
        all, though, wrestling has given me a love of life. Through this sport, I have experienced pain, sacrifice,
        adversity, and success. Exposure to these feelings-which are, in my opinion, the essence of being-has allowed
        me to truly appreciate life. I hope to continue wrestling at Georgetown.

      <h2>Books</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="begin">I find Hermann Hesse's book</span>, Narcissus and Goldmund, intellectually exciting. After reading the book last year,
        I remember putting it down and sighing contentedly. I had, after a sleepless night, finally finished. What
        I reveled in was not the fact that I could sleep, but that I had come away with an inexplicable something.
        It was not an understanding which could be pinpointed and explained. Rather, it was a sense I felt in the depths
        of my soul. And yet, what delighted me more was that I knew that I had only begun to understand the book; that
        there remained countless messages which I could only sense but not grasp. Here, finally, I had a book which
        could be re-read. And every time I finished, I would come away with a new understanding of something I could not
        put into words. Unlike the normal academic, I do not want to find the final answer for everything. Throughout my
        life, I have always felt a sense of loss after succeeding in a long search. For me, it is not the ends I seek,
        but the means themselves. I am perfectly content to never find the final answer as long as I will always be able
        to find a better one.
