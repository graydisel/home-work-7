          <h2>For a More Creative Brain Follow These 5 Steps</h2>
          <p class="overflow">
            Nearly all great ideas follow a similar creative process and this article explains how this process works.
            Understanding this is important because creative thinking is one of the most useful skills you can possess.
            Nearly every problem you face in work and in life can benefit from innovative solutions, lateral thinking,
            and creative ideas. Anyone can learn to be creative by using these five steps. That’s not to say being
            creative is easy. Uncovering your creative genius requires courage and tons of practice. However,
            this five-step approach should help demystify the creative process and illuminate the path to more
            innovative thinking. To explain how this process works, let me tell you a short story. In the 1870s,
            newspapers and printers faced a very specific and very costly problem. Photography was a new and exciting
            medium at the time. Readers wanted to see more pictures, but nobody could figure out how to print images
            quickly and cheaply. For example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s, they had to
            commission an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were used
            to press the image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses. This process of photoengraving,
            you can imagine, was remarkably time consuming and expensive. The man who invented a solution to this
            problem was named Frederic Eugene Ives. He went on to become a trailblazer in the field of photography and
            held over 70 patents by the end of his career. His story of creativity and innovation, which I will share
            now, is a useful case study for understanding the 5 key steps of the creative process. A Flash of Insight
            Ives got his start as a printer’s apprentice in Ithaca, New York. After two years of learning the ins and
            outs of the printing process, he began managing the photographic laboratory at nearby Cornell University.
            He spent the rest of the decade experimenting with new photography techniques and learning about cameras,
            printers, and optics. In 1881, Ives had a flash of insight regarding a better printing technique. “While
            operating my photostereotype process in Ithaca, I studied the problem of halftone process,” Ives said. “I
            went to bed one night in a state of brain fog over the problem, and the instant I woke in the morning saw
            before me, apparently projected on the ceiling, the completely worked out process and equipment in operation.”
            Ives quickly translated his vision into reality and patented his printing approach in 1881. He spent the
            remainder of the decade improving upon it. By 1885, he had developed a simplified process that delivered
            even better results. The Ives Process, as it came to be known, reduced the cost of printing images by 15x and
            remained the standard printing technique for the next 80 years. Alright, now let’s discuss what lessons we
            can learn from Ives about the creative process.

          <h2>The Ultimate Productivity Hack is Saying No</h2>
          <p class="overflow">
            The ultimate productivity hack is saying no.
            Not doing something will always be faster than doing it. This statement reminds me of the old computer
            programming saying, “Remember that there is no code faster than no code.” The same philosophy applies in
            other areas of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes faster than not having a meeting at all.
            This is not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is that we say yes to many things
            we don’t actually want to do. There are many meetings held that don’t need to be held. There is a lot of
            code written that could be deleted. How often do people ask you to do something and you just reply, “Sure
            thing.” Three days later, you’re overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list. We become frustrated by our
            obligations even though we were the ones who said yes to them in the first place. It’s worth asking if
            things are necessary. Many of them are not, and a simple “no” will be more productive than whatever work the
            most efficient person can muster. But if the benefits of saying no are so obvious, then why do we say yes so
            often? Why We Say Yes. We agree to many requests not because we want to do them, but because we don’t want
            to be seen as rude, arrogant, or unhelpful. Often, you have to consider saying no to someone you will
            interact with again in the future—your co-worker, your spouse, your family and friends. Saying no to these
            people can be particularly difficult because we like them and want to support them. (Not to mention, we
            often need their help too.) Collaborating with others is an important element of life. The thought of
            straining the relationship outweighs the commitment of our time and energy. For this reason, it can be
            helpful to be gracious in your response. Do whatever favors you can, and be warm-hearted and direct when you
            have to say no. But even after we have accounted for these social considerations, many of us still seem to
            do a poor job of managing the tradeoff between yes and no. We find ourselves over-committed to things that
            don’t meaningfully improve or support those around us, and certainly don’t improve our own lives. Perhaps
            one issue is how we think about the meaning of yes and no.
