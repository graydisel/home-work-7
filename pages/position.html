        <h3>How to wake up early, even if you're not a morning person</h3>
        <p>
          For some people, waking up early just feels natural. Carla Finley is a baker in Brooklyn, N.Y., who starts her
          day at 5 or 6 a.m. Finley is what we would call a morning person.
          "Sometimes it's still dark, which actually I love," she says. "Something about feeling the light come in feels
          really sacred."

          Of course, not everyone is as lucky as Finley. Emily Gerard is a writer for the Today show, and she often finds
          herself waking up at odd hours to prepare for the show, which starts at 7 a.m.
          "When that alarm goes off, I have a few moments of feeling like I want to die," she says.
          There are a lot of reasons why we may have to get up early. Maybe it's for work, or maybe it's to get your kids
          ready for school or take care of a family member. Maybe you just want some time to work on your hobby or take
          care of errands before a busy day.
          But if you're not naturally a morning person, how much room do you have to change your wake-up schedule?
          "We have a fair amount of wiggle room, but it's behavioral," says Dr. Katie Sharkey, an associate professor of
          medicine and psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University's Alpert Medical School.
          Basically, your biological clock, which determines your circadian rhythms, is baked into who you are to an
          extent, but a few habits can help make waking up earlier less of a chore.
          The most potent way to get your body feeling awake is to expose yourself to light when you wake up, says Dr.
          Afifa Shamim-Uzzaman, an associate professor at the University of Michigan and the director of the Ann Arbor VA
          Sleep Disorders Center.
          5 tips to help you reset after the daylight saving time change
          Sunlight helps regulate your internal clock by curbing a sleep-regulating hormone called melatonin. If you live
          somewhere where it's dark in the mornings, a broad-spectrum light box can be helpful to simulate sunlight and
          trick your body into feeling more alert.
          "When you're exposed to bright sunlight, it shuts [melatonin production] off, sort of telling the body, 'Hey,
          it's time to be awake,' " Shamim-Uzzaman says.
          Conversely, at night, don't blast your eyes with bright lights, especially blue light from screens. Those lights
          will signal to your body that it's still daytime, which definitely won't help if you're trying to go to bed on
          time for an early wake-up.
          Movement
          Exercise, or just getting your body moving in the morning, is another way to tell your body clock it's time to
          be awake. "It's going to be a lot more important to be more active during the daytime or earlier in the
          mornings," says Shamim-Uzzaman. Maybe that means going for a morning run instead of an evening one, doing a few
          minutes of yoga in your living room or just doing some jumping jacks when you get out of bed.
          Consistency
          Sharkey and Shamim-Uzzaman agree that whatever you do, it's important to keep a fairly consistent sleep schedule.
          Even making sure that you're eating at about the same time relative to when you go to bed can make a difference.

          Sleep better with these bedtime rituals
          That means if you're waking up early for work during the week, try to wake up at most a couple of hours later on
          the weekends.
          "You just don't want to have the shift that you're making between days off and days on so wide that it's
          basically like you're flying over six time zones every weekend," says Sharkey. "Because we know that that's
          probably not good for the body clock."
